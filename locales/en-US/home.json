  "About_Title": "Flashpoint is a webgame preservation project.",
  "About_Para1": "Internet history and culture is important, and content made on web platforms such as Adobe Flash make up a significant portion of that culture. This project is dedicated to preserving as many experiences from these platforms as possible, so that they aren't lost to time. Since December 2017, Flashpoint has saved {over {} games and animations running on {} different platforms}.",
  "About_Para2": "In addition to the archive itself, we also provide a highly flexible software package for reliable navigation and playback of preserved content. Among the software included is {a fully-featured launcher} that interacts with the archive, {a proxy} that tricks games into thinking they're running on the live web, and {a sandbox} that allows for secure usage of browser plugins - all of which are {open-source software}.",
  "About_Para3": "Flashpoint {was originally started} by BlueMaxima in an attempt to outrun the disappearance of webgames prior to the death of Flash. It has since evolved into an international project involving over 200 community contributors, encompassing both games and animations created for numerous internet plugins, frameworks, and standards.",
  "About_Para4": "This project {strives to be not-for-profit}, to preserve the sense of community and sharing that came with Flash and its ilk. To learn more about Flashpoint, refer to the sidebar on the left of the page.",
