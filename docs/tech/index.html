			The 3D Groove engine was created by the company The Groove Alliance. At first there was 3D Groove SX, which allowed developers with Director to create a Shockwave Movie with a 3D Groove game. In 2002, 3D Groove GX was introduced, and allowed for the creation of 3D Groove games without the need for Director. With 3D Groove GX, developers would use the private SDK provided by The Groove Alliance to create Groove World Files. 3D Groove used the 3D Game Machine development framework (3DGM for short) from Virtually Unlimited Corp. In September 2001, 3D Groove bought the source code for 3DGM.

			3DVIA Player (formerly 3D Life Player, Virtools Player, and NeMo Web Player, not to be confused with 3DVIA Studio/Beta Player or 3DVIA Composer Player) was a browser plugin by Dassault Systèmes for the playback of 3D experiences made in Virtools. It was meant for advanced, practical applications of 3D such as computer based training, virtual tours and real estate. 3DVIA Player was also used for webgames.

			ActiveX is a software framework that allows encapsulating a program as a container for use in other programs. ActiveX Controls could be used, for example, to embed Windows Media Player into PowerPoint, to embed a 3D model into Acrobat Reader, and generally served as a standard to embed programs into other unrelated programs. ActiveX Controls may be embed into HTML content and hosted in Internet Explorer. Ad-hoc, single purpose ActiveX Controls may be created specifically for use in Internet Explorer, for the purpose of webgame playback. Flashpoint uses the Flashpoint Secure Player for ActiveX Controls, because ActiveX Controls have no sandboxing and a reputation of being insecure.

			Adobe Flash Player (also just Flash, formerly Macromedia Flash Player) is a player for vector animations and graphics, sometimes with added interactivity. It was often used as a medium for webgames due to its effective compression, low price, ease of use and large install base. When it was first introduced, it was capable of little more than basic animations with buttons to control them. As it gained popularity, new versions included more advanced features, especially with the added support for ActionScript 3.0.

			Adobe Shockwave Player (also Shockwave, formerly Macromedia Shockwave Player or Shockwave Director Player) is a player for compressed, rich internet media. It plays Shockwave Movies created using Director. Director could be used to create advanced applications with a variety of multimedia and the Lingo programming language, using a movie metaphor.

			Based on tech being developed since 1989, Hypercosm is a 3D-content web player launched in 1999. The company made a hefty investment that didn’t pay back, being one of the many victims of the Dot Com crash, folding in 2003. But thanks to a contract with NASA, the company managed to bounce back somewhat, and continued working on new projects until fading away in 2011.

			Launched in early 1996 by Superscape with support from Intel as part of their 200Mhz marketing campaign, Viscape was a proprietary 3D modelling language based on the VRML 1.0 standard. In 1997 it received an update in the form of Viscape Universal, to take advantage of VRML97. Although in its early days it had an advantage over standard VRML, it quickly became outdated, being called cumbersome even by 1998. With the last update being launched in 2000, it faded into obscurity with very few apps still being made for it. Superscape was bought by Glu Mobile in 2008.

			Unity Engine is a cross-platform game engine that aimed to make game development more accessible, and is the most popular third-party game development software amongst developers worldwide. Created alongside Unity itself and implemented in the first patch in 2005, Unity Web Player was a tool that let Unity content be played on the internet. It remained a popular option for 3D games, but with the removal of NPAPI support in 2016, the plugin was dropped in favor of Unity WebGL.
